/*

Given an array Arr of size N containing positive integers. Find the maximum sum of a any possible subsequence such that no two numbers in the subsequence should be adjacent in Arr.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 6
Arr[] = {5, 5, 10, 100, 10, 5}
Output: 110
Explanation: If you take indices 0, 3
and 5, then Arr[0]+Arr[3]+Arr[5] =
5+100+5 = 110.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
Arr[] = {3, 2, 7, 10}
Output: 13
Explanation: 3 and 10 forms a non
continuous subsequence with maximum
sum.
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function findMaxSum() which takes the array of integers Arr and N as parameters and returns an the maximum sum possible of any valid subsequence.

Expected Time Complexity: O(N)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ N ≤ 105
1 ≤ Arri ≤ 105
